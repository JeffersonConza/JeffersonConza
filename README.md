## 🔦 My Love for PyTorch

````markdown
PyTorch turns mathematical ideas into tensors, tensors into models,  
and models into intelligent systems that learn from the world.

From `autograd` magic to GPU-powered training loops,  
PyTorch feels less like coding and more like speaking computational math fluently.

<3 PyTorch + CUDA <3

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.net = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(10, 32),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(32, 1)
        )
    def forward(self, x):
        return self.net(x)

model = MyModel()
x = torch.randn(1, 10)
print("PyTorch says:", model(x))
